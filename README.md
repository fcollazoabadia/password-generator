# Password Generator

## Description

*The purpose of this project was to add the necessary code to create a functioning password generator.
*added variables to house all character values for the generator to pull from.
*added a function to generate passwords.
*added prompts for the user to work within numeric parameters, and provide options for different types of characters to generate. 
*added a for loop to randomly pull characters and then concatenate them within chosen parameters. 
*In the process I familiarized myself with the basic ideas behind functions, arrays, for loops, as well as if/else statements.
